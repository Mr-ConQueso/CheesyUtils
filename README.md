# CheesyUtils

CheesyUtils is a Unity package that provides a collection of useful utilities, extension methods, and helper functions to streamline Unity development. This project incorporates publicly available code from [Unity-Utils by Git-Amend](https://github.com/adammyhre/Unity-Utils), along with additional features and improvements developed by me, [Mr.ConQueso](https://github.com/Mr-ConQueso).  

## Features

- **Extension Methods:** Enhance Unity and C# built-in types with additional functionalities.  
- **Conversion Methods:** Convert vectors and quaternions between `System.Numerics` and `UnityEngine`.
- **Serializable Objects:** Serialize anything! from vectors and quaternions, to structs and `ScriptableObjects`, perfect for a saving system.
- **Hotkeys:** Useful shortcuts for locking the Inspector, closing tabs, compiling the project, and more.  
- **Helpers:** Static utility methods, such as `NonAlloc WaitForSeconds`, for optimized performance.  
- **Singletons:** Generic singleton patterns for various use cases.  

## Dependencies

CheesyUtils requires the Core RP Library for certain functionalities, such as the `LoadVolumeProfile()` extension.  

## Installation & Usage

To use CheesyUtils in your Unity project, you can download the package and import it manually, or install it via Unity's Package Manager using the following URL:
